// A Content-Security-Policy that is missing an origin does not fail loudly. It is report-only here,
// so today the request goes through and a violation is logged where nobody is looking; the day
// CSP_ENFORCE is turned on, the feature simply stops working — and the symptom is a form that does
// nothing, on a page nobody changed.
//
// That already happened: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set on the baker app and NOT on marketing, which
// never called the API until the demo form did. Marketing builds its own API URL from the base
// domain, so connect-src came out as `'self' blob: data: <turnstile>` and every submission logged a
// violation.
//
// Pure — buildCsp reads only the env object it is handed, so this needs no network and no build.
// Run via `npm run check:csp`.
